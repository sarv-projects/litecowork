# UI behavior - Safe Task Path

Behavior, not pixels. Screen inventory: [V1-UI-SCREEN-CONTRACT.md](../../../docs/V1-UI-SCREEN-CONTRACT.md). Control classes: [V1-SETTINGS-CONTRACT-LEDGER.md](../../../docs/V1-SETTINGS-CONTRACT-LEDGER.md) and [SEMANTIC-SERVED-UI-MAP.md](../../../docs/SEMANTIC-SERVED-UI-MAP.md). Action states: [V1-UI-ACTION-STATE-LEDGER.md](../../../docs/V1-UI-ACTION-STATE-LEDGER.md).

## Flows and states

- Run as Task is a separate review, not a send side effect.
- Plan accept precedes the edit.
- Unknown result is not shown as verified.

## Commands

The UI renders owner state and sends the Operator command named by the canonical API. It does not encode a second state machine. TARGET controls stay disabled until a served handler exists.

## Validation

Empty, denied, stale version, offline and unqualified provider states are visible. Success requires a receipt or a verified observation.
